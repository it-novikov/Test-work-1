# InvoltaTestTask
App resembling a messenger.

It:

- loads messages from the server keeping the chronology,
 
- displays them in reverse order (scroll up, as in telegram),

- supports system theme (dark and light),

- contains a stub and an attempt to re-request in case there is no Internet or an invalid response from the server.

I will refine it in the future.

Upcoming updates: refactoring network layer, new interface using xib and autolayout.
